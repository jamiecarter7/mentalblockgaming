Looking to re-texture the sign in your Minecraft resource pack? Look no further…

After several hours of modding assets for our maps I wanted to post this quick reference guide. The reason being that I found editing the sign assets one of the more awkward to get right.

## The sign structure

Here are the screenshots of the texture to help with placement.

Here is the base texture to build on.
