        This puzzle/adventure map is a three player cooperative experience like
        no other. Decipher your way through more than 10 unique and stimulating
        chambers with more than 4 hours of gameplay. Manipulate water, iron and
        even time in order to progress under the supervision of your friendly
        host, Harold.<strong

        This puzzle is designed for three players – not one, not two, not four,
        but THREE players. You will need to rely on each other in order to
        progress through the puzzles. Some form of communication is highly
        recommended between the players, such as being in the same room or using
        Skype.

        There are no mods required for this map; however, Command Blocks must be
        enabled – to do so, open server.properties and insert the following line
        at the bottom before booting the server:enable-command-block=true. This
        is our first Minecraft map and we welcome any suggestions/ideas you may
        have to improve it.

          “Masterpiece!” THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE! This was the most fun I’ve had
          in a adventure map in a long time! I sure hope there will be a part 2
          or another one.
