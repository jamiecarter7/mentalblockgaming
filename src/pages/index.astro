    From the Blog MBG’s Latest Venture: Ann Achronist, a time-travelling
    narrative adventure game! Oct 24, 2018 Adventure Start! Hey! Thanks for
    checking out the dev log! Every week I will be posting updates on the
    development of Ann Achronist so little by little you can see the game come
    to life for yourselves! First things first: Ann wandering 17th-century
    Alderdale Who is Ann Achronist? Ann Achronist finds herself in a fix: down
    and out, left with nothing, life has not been kind to her. But that all
    changes when she comes across a mystical ring, imbued with the power to
    travel to the past. Enter 17th century Alderdale, seek out your ancestors,
    and cause a ripple through time big enough to shake up your present. Pave
    the way to fortune, fame, and fortitude in this charming narrative
    adventure. – Encounter a host of delightful and dreadful Alderdalians whom
    you may entertain or infuriate at your will. There’s no need to fear the
    consequences: time (travel) is a great healer. – Your actions directly
    impact your future. Learn new skills and forge alliances to aid future trips
    to the past. – Not everything is as it seems: uncover the townspeople’s
    secrets to discover ulterior motives and hidden locations. Jump from
    timeline to timeline in order to carve out a better future for your
    ancestors, and — by extension — for yourself. When will the game be
    released? Release is slated for the final quarter of 2018. This all depends
    on how smoothly development goes and how much time any commissioned pieces
    take to finish, but that’s the rough estimate right now. Who are you? I’m
    Dan (or MaybeLaterx of Mental Block Gaming), a 25-year-old game designer cum
    programmer from England. I originally studied French and German at
    university before shifting my focus to game development. I’ve been
    developing games for 4 years now, starting with Minecraft redstone, to
    command blocks, to drag’n’drop code and beyond, and this will be my second
    big project made in Unity. Looking forward to sharing my progress with you!
