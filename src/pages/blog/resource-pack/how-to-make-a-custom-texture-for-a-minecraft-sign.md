Looking to re-texture the sign in your Minecraft resource pack? Look no further…

After several hours of modding assets for our maps I wanted to post this quick reference guide. The reason being that I found editing the sign assets one of the more awkward to get right.

## The sign structure

Here are the screenshots of the texture to help with placement.

Here is the base texture to build on.

## Color key

Purple – Front (Text Area) <br />
Orange – Top edge <br />
Dark Green – Left edge (when looking at the front) <br />
Blue – Right edge (when looking at the front) <br />
Red – Back <br />
Orange – Top edge <br />
Yellow – Bottom Edge <br />
Grey – Front of pole <br />
Black – Left of pole (when looking at the front) <br />
Green – Right of pole (when looking at the front) <br />
Light Purple – Back of pole <br />
Turquoise – Bottom of pole <br />

Hope this guide helps you save some time when trying to texture the Minecraft sign!

Happy Modding!
